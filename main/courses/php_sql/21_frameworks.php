<h1>Popular PHP Frameworks</h1>
<p>In the professional world, developers rarely build large applications using "vanilla" or "raw" PHP. Instead, they use <strong>Frameworks</strong>—pre-built collections of libraries and architectural patterns (like MVC) that provide a foundation for your project.</p>

<h2>Why Use a Framework?</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Frameworks provide built-in protection against SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF out of the box.</li>
    <li><strong>Routing:</strong> Easy management of URLs and how they map to your code.</li>
    <li><strong>ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):</strong> Allows you to interact with your database using PHP objects instead of writing raw SQL.</li>
    <li><strong>Community:</strong> If you get stuck, thousands of other developers have already solved the same problem using the same framework.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Leading Frameworks</h2>

<h3>1. Laravel (The King of Elegance)</h3>
<p>Laravel is currently the most popular PHP framework in the world. It is famous for its clean syntax and its "batteries-included" philosophy.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Features:</strong> Blade Templating (for beautiful Views), Eloquent ORM, and "Artisan" command-line tool.</li>
    <li><strong>Ecosystem:</strong> It has massive tools like <strong>Forge</strong> (deployment) and <strong>Nova</strong> (admin panels).</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Symfony (The Enterprise Titan)</h3>
<p>Symfony is a collection of high-quality PHP components used by thousands of applications, including Laravel and Drupal.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Strength:</strong> It is highly modular—you can use just one "Component" without using the whole framework. It is the gold standard for large-scale corporate apps.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. CodeIgniter (The Lightweight)</h3>
<p>If you need a framework with a very small footprint and high performance, CodeIgniter is an excellent choice. It is much simpler to learn than Laravel or Symfony.</p>

    <strong>Success Path:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Master the PHP Fundamentals (Variables, Arrays, Loops).</li>
        <li>Learn SQL and Database Design.</li>
        <li>Build a raw PHP app with PDO and Prepared Statements.</li>
        <li>Move to **Laravel** to build professional, portfolio-ready projects.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<h2>What is "Artisan"?</h2>
<p>Modern frameworks come with a Command-Line Interface (CLI). Laravel's tool is called <strong>Artisan</strong>. It helps you automate common tasks.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># Creating a new Controller automatically
php artisan make:controller UserController

# Running database migrations (updates)
php artisan migrate</code></pre>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    <strong>Final Thought:</strong> A framework is a tool, not a replacement for knowing PHP. The best developers understand how the framework works "under the hood."

<h1 id="logops">Logical Operators</h1>

<h2>What are Logical Operators?</h2>
<p>Logical operators allow you to combine multiple conditions together. They are essential for creating more complex decision logic.</p>

<h2>AND Operator (&&)</h2>
<p>The AND operator returns true only when <strong>both</strong> conditions are true.</p>

<h2>OR Operator (||)</h2>
<p>The OR operator returns true when <strong>at least one</strong> condition is true.</p>

<h2>NOT Operator (!)</h2>
<p>The NOT operator reverses a boolean value. True becomes false, and false becomes true.</p>

<h2>Combining Logical Operators</h2>
<p>You can combine all three logical operators for complex conditions:</p>

<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Use parentheses for clarity, especially with complex conditions</li>
    <li>Keep conditions readable - break up very long conditions across multiple lines</li>
    <li>Use meaningful variable names so conditions are self-documenting</li>
    <li>Avoid deeply nested logical operators</li>
</ul>
